Project: Movie Recommendation System
Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python, which suggests movies to users based on their preferences. It uses a content-based filtering approach, where similarity between movies is calculated using their attributes (such as movie descriptions, genres, etc.).

Features
Content-based filtering: Recommends movies similar to the one selected by the user.
Movie similarity scoring: Calculates similarity scores between movies using cosine similarity.
Recommendations: Suggests a list of top 30 similar movies based on the user's input.
Libraries Used:
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms like TfidfVectorizer and cosine_similarity.
Numpy: For numerical operations.
Steps in the Notebook:
Loading the dataset: The movie dataset is loaded and preprocessed to be used for recommendation.
Data cleaning: Handles missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues in the data.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Converts movie descriptions into a numerical matrix using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Cosine Similarity Calculation: Computes the cosine similarity between the movies based on their descriptions.
Recommendation: Based on the selected movie, it recommends the top 30 similar movies.
How to Run the Project
Install the required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
Open the notebook Movie_Recommendation.ipynb.
Execute each cell in order. The final section of the notebook will ask for a movie and provide a list of recommended movies based on similarity.
